Single-ended charge amplifier
=============================

Cfb = 1000pF, Rfb = 200Mohm
Gain relatively okay - detects slight tapping

Cfb = 100pF, Rfb = 200Mohm
Much more sensitive - barely tapping registers strongly

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 200Mohm
Extremely sensitive - barely have to touch

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 1Gohm
Still extremely sensitive - moreso to taps

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 500Mohm
Seems same as last

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 100Mohm
Seems same as last

All of the above: frequently encounter 60Hz noise

Differential charge amplifier
=============================
Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 100Mohm
Very good! Works well at detecting faucet on.

Consider using DAC to generate Vcc/2 reference

Need to look at increasing Rfb to increase SNR (see page 3 of TI signal conditioning full pdf)
Cheapest SMD: 470M, 150M, 270M, 200M, 500M, 250M

Testing 12/4/16
===============
Tested using Cfb = 100pF, Rfb = 100Mohm
Software: ~5.3kHz samplerate (80MHz clk/256, 47.5 cycle tsample). Averaging samples worked poorly, but then I realized
that an average should completely cancel out the signal since it's differential. Switched to calculating the standard
deviation instead. This seems to work a lot better. Considering going to calculating min/max instead relative to mean.
Very sensitive, but also to random shocks to sink. 
Changing to the sensor with mass increased sensitivity to shocks, but decreased to vibration.
Thinking cutoff frequency (159Hz) of Cfb and Rfb could be causing issue - vibrations seem to be around 100Hz with
a harmonic or other vibration closer to 1000Hz. If I want to keep trying to detect vibration, maybe tweak Rfb or Cfb
for a higher cutoff frequency (1-2.5kHz?)

Notes 12/5/16
=============
I discovered that the Vcc/2 reference was still a simple voltage divider rather than a buffered reference. I changed
the circuit to be buffered through the STM32 opamp with a gain of 1. The overall working of the charge amplifier circuit
improved immensely - now the scope actually shows a big difference between the water running and being off. Testing
showed that larger gain was needed for good results, ie Cfb=10pF and Rfb=100M.

Notes 12/7/16
=============
I noticed with longer cable on USB power, it's possible for the amplifier to go into oscillation at 60Hz. I tried increasing
Rfb all the way up to 400Mohm with no improvement to speak of. The circuit works well enough, but as an improvement.
I also breadboarded maxim's application circuit tonight. The gain was ridiculously high. At first, I had R1=R2=1M and C3=0.05uF,
changing these back to the standard values did not help. I then dialed back R9 to 10k in hopes of lowering the gain enough,
but it was still too high (much higher than the previous circuit). Then I increased C1=C2=100pF. This helped, but it was still
too high. Note, for all of this I used R3=R4=100M because I didn't want to bother with lowering those values. Finally I
increased C1 and C2 to 1000pF, which brought the gain in line with what I had previously seen on the other single amp
circuit. There is definitely better 60Hz rejection with this topology, but it's not perfect. Furthermore, if I went this
route I wouldn't be able to use the single opamp with SHDN pin like I was hoping for low-power support.

PCB Layout 12/18/16
===================
I laid out the board using the MAX4256 (single opamp with SHDN in 8-SOIC package). However, if it is necessary to use a 
MAX4257, make the following changes: May need to cut the AMP_SHDN trace going to pin 8 and tie pin 8 to +3.3V, or could still
"power" the amp with the AMP_SHDN pin. Cut the trace +3.3V trace going to pin 7. Cut tthe trace going from pin 6 to C4.
Tie pins 6 and 7 together to connect Vin- to the output. Connect pin 5 to the VCC_2_BUF net with a jumper. Finally connect 
pin 1 to pin 1 of R5 (the Vout net, before R6).
