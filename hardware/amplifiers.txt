Single-ended charge amplifier
=============================

Cfb = 1000pF, Rfb = 200Mohm
Gain relatively okay - detects slight tapping

Cfb = 100pF, Rfb = 200Mohm
Much more sensitive - barely tapping registers strongly

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 200Mohm
Extremely sensitive - barely have to touch

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 1Gohm
Still extremely sensitive - moreso to taps

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 500Mohm
Seems same as last

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 100Mohm
Seems same as last

All of the above: frequently encounter 60Hz noise

Differential charge amplifier
=============================
Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 100Mohm
Very good! Works well at detecting faucet on.

Consider using DAC to generate Vcc/2 reference

Need to look at increasing Rfb to increase SNR (see page 3 of TI signal conditioning full pdf)
Cheapest SMD: 470M, 150M, 270M, 200M, 500M, 250M

Testing 12/4/16
===============
Tested using Cfb = 100pF, Rfb = 100Mohm
Software: ~5.3kHz samplerate (80MHz clk/256, 47.5 cycle tsample). Averaging samples worked poorly, but then I realized
that an average should completely cancel out the signal since it's differential. Switched to calculating the standard
deviation instead. This seems to work a lot better. Considering going to calculating min/max instead relative to mean.
Very sensitive, but also to random shocks to sink. 
Changing to the sensor with mass increased sensitivity to shocks, but decreased to vibration.
Thinking cutoff frequency (159Hz) of Cfb and Rfb could be causing issue - vibrations seem to be around 100Hz with
a harmonic or other vibration closer to 1000Hz. If I want to keep trying to detect vibration, maybe tweak Rfb or Cfb
for a higher cutoff frequency (1-2.5kHz?)

Notes 12/5/16
=============
I discovered that the Vcc/2 reference was still a simple voltage divider rather than a buffered reference. I changed
the circuit to be buffered through the STM32 opamp with a gain of 1. The overall working of the charge amplifier circuit
improved immensely - now the scope actually shows a big difference between the water running and being off. Testing
showed that larger gain was needed for good results, ie Cfb=10pF and Rfb=100M.
