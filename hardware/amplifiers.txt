Single-ended charge amplifier
=============================

Cfb = 1000pF, Rfb = 200Mohm
Gain relatively okay - detects slight tapping

Cfb = 100pF, Rfb = 200Mohm
Much more sensitive - barely tapping registers strongly

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 200Mohm
Extremely sensitive - barely have to touch

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 1Gohm
Still extremely sensitive - moreso to taps

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 500Mohm
Seems same as last

Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 100Mohm
Seems same as last

All of the above: frequently encounter 60Hz noise

Differential charge amplifier
=============================
Cfb = 10pF, Rfb = 100Mohm
Very good! Works well at detecting faucet on.

Consider using DAC to generate Vcc/2 reference

Need to look at increasing Rfb to increase SNR (see page 3 of TI signal conditioning full pdf)
Cheapest SMD: 470M, 150M, 270M, 200M, 500M, 250M
