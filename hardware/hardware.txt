LEDs
====
If 3.2V is not right enough on Green/Blue, could either remove series resistors, or go to up to 3.4 or 3.5V supply for micro (3.6V is max)

assume 3.3V supply:
Red: needs >=70 ohm (use 47+33=80)
Green/Blue: Needs >=5 ohm (10ohm in || )

From testing:
Rred = 78ohm (10+68), Ired = 18.49mA (78.7 is a standard value)
Rgreen = 10ohm, Igreen = 19.70mA
Rblue = 22ohm, Iblue = 19.64mA

Rred = 78ohm (10+68), Ired = 18.49mA
Rgreen = 12.2ohm (15||68), Igreen = 18.28mA
Rblue = 25ohm (15+25), Iblue = 18.60mA

Pin notes
=========
If you want to use a WKUP pin, must use WKUP4. In that case, cannot use LPUART.
On Nucleo board, VCP is connected to PA2 and PA15 (USART2).
If you want to power directly from 3.3V, need to remove some SB's

Clocks
======
MSI is much more power friendly than HSI48, also starts up faster (190uA vs 380uA) - although stabilization time is longer
HSI16 is very similar to MSI for current - both 190uA. Stabilization is much better though.

ADC
===
Be sure to calibrate ADC on powerup. Software can save the calibration value and restore it each time.
Is being very picky - seems to always be one conversion short in interrupt or polling mode, unless I slow the ADC way down (/128 clk).
Per datasheet, Vrefint needs a sampele time of 4us minimum.
If using oversampling on both regular and injected channels, the oversampling ratio must be the same! (or reconfigured before starting each conversion)

Piezo amplifier circuit
=======================
Bias at Vcc/2 to avoid issues with differential signal.
Need to drive into ~10kohm load
Supply current to TLV2772: ~1.5mA
Current to MAX4257: ~1.0mA

Choose MAX4256 (has SHDN input)

Temperature sensor
==================
Configure UART Tx/Rx pin as Open-Drain, with no internal pull up/down. The internal pullup is not strong enough.
Use an external 4.7kohm pullup.

CRC:
Both input and output needs to be configured to reverse bits, byte-wise. Use Dallas 1-wire CRC polynomial 0x31.
